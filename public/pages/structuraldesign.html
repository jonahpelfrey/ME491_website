				When fastening two pieces of metal together with a rivet, the minimum diameter for the rivet should be no less than the thickest piece to be riveted. The maximum diameter should be no greater than three times the thickest piece to be riveted. 
				</p>
				<p>
				When determining rivet length a simple formula may be utilized as L = 1.5*D + G where D is the diameter of the rivet to be used, G is the total thickness of the material, and L is the length of the rivet to be used. The length of blind fasteners can be obtained from manufacture documentation. Many fastener companies use the total thickness of the material in question to denote the proper fastener length.
				</p>
				<p>
				Many technical documents may be sourced for proper rivet hole layout procedure. A few basic industry standard operating procedures ensure that proper fastening can be obtained. Edge Distance, or the distance from the edge of the material to the center of the rivet hole, should be no less than twice the diameter of the fastener (2D) and no more than four times its diameter (4D). Flush fasteners require a minimum edge distance of (2.5D). Edge distance is labeled A. in Figure 1 below.
				</p>
				<p>
				Rivet spacing, or pitch, is labeled B. in Figure 1 Below. It is a good practice to keep the rivet pitch at a minimum or four times the diameter (4D) of the rivet and no more than eight times the diameter (8D).
				</p>
				<p>
				Transverse rivet pitch is utilized for may repair applications. In some instances it may be required to perform a lap or flush patch when repairing a section of metal. For this application rivet spacing should be approximately 75% of the existing rivet pitch but should not exceed (2.5D) (1).

				<p><b>Blind Fasteners Used in Construction:</b></p>
				<p>
					BOM’s - Structural components of the Badgerloop pod require more tensile strength than attached sheeting. For this application our team selected the HUCK BOM. This fastener is often used in place of a weld. The ¼ inch diameter BOM used most widely in our application provides 22,690 [N] Shear Strength and 14,460 [N] Tensile Strength (5). While preparation of the hole is more time consuming than that of a standard blind fastener, the BOM is easily installed with a pneumatic gun. The ease of use also make this option attractive for the large number of members able to use this system without lengthy training.
 
				</p>
				<p>
					For hole preparation the members must be clamped or temporarily fastened in place. General hole layout procedure should be observed and the attached manufactures document should be consulted for diameter and length of fastener (https://www.arconic.com/fastening_systems_and_rings/commercial/catalog/pdf/huck/en/AF201_Bom_Brochure.pdf). Holes are initially piloting. Once adequate fastening has been provided, the holes may be taken to pre-ream size. d with a drill bit smaller than the pre-ream size allowing additional temporary fastening. This size should be the diameter of the pilot on the final reamer or, if a piloted reamer can not be found, a drill size one dimension smaller than the required reamer size should be used. After drilling is complete the hole should be reamed to it’s final size. Install temporary fasteners into holes that have been completed and continue with holes that contain the original temporary fasteners. Once all holes have been reamed, disassemble the parts and deburr all holes. The addition of a sealant between the metal, with a corrosion inhibiting compound, is recommended before the final parts are assembled. Use temporary fasteners to secure the parts together for fastener installation. The practice of dipping each fastener into a primer paint is recommended to lessen the ability for dissimilar metal corrosion from forming. Finally, install the fastener with the appropriate pneumatic BOM gun making sure to apply even pressure to the head while pulling the trigger.

					Pop rivets are more commonly utilized in areas requiring less tensile or shear strength. We will use these rivets to attach sheet aluminum to structural members, fastening of smaller door components, construction of electrical boxes, and other miscellaneous assemblies. Pop rivets are designed to be used when traditional aluminum or steel solid rivets can not be.
				</p>
				<p>
					To install Pop rivets the general hole layout should be observed. In a similar manner to the BOM installation, mark the fastener rows and clamp material together. Holes may be drilled to size, although caution should be taken when drilling immediately to final size. Recommendations could be made to drill one size smaller and install temporary fasteners as drilling is being completed. Once drilling is done, separate and debur each hole on either side. This will ensure cracking does not occur due to unnecessary stress concentration points. Anytime metal is to be bonded an adhesive with a corrosion inhibiting compound is recommended but not required in this case. Perform any countersinking necessary if 100 degree flush rivets are to be used.

					The structure is made from 6061-T6 Aluminum. This material was chosen for its light weight and relatively inexpensive cost. The ultimate tensile strength of the aluminum is 45,000 [psi], a tensile yield strength of 40,000 [psi], and a Shear Strength of 31,000 [psi]. 6061-T6 Aluminum is commonly used for structural components, bicycle frames, boat docks, marine applications, storage tanks, and aircraft. It’s easy formability and weldability were also taken into account when choosing this material.

					Initial FEA’s indicated that the original placement of the crane lift points on the inner most bulkheads would likely cause failure during lift. As the pod became heavier the model predicted a factor of safety of 1.2 at the weakest point. This FOS did not meet the specified criteria and needed to be redesigned with the intention of strengthening the structure on lift. Further analysis conducted in ANSYS Workbench allowed the team to verify that movement of the lift points farther forward and aft would easily resolve this problem.

				</p>
				<p>
					Although a lengthy process, the lift points were removed from the inner bulkheads and relocated forward and aft of their original positions to facilitate a higher factor of safety upon lift of the pod. New lift points were fabricated to accommodate the new angle. The lift points were redrilled to match existing holes and reinstalled with the necessary BOMS.
